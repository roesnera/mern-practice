# mern-practice

I created this project as a continued effort to practice my skills with Supabase and ERN (mern with no mongodb)

it currently works on my supabase database, if you download it and run "npm run build && node server.js" in the root of the project, you can navigate to localhost:3000 to check it out

I shamelessly copped the styling from a react course that I am currently taking. I do plan to update and change the styling, but for now c'est la vie et je ne regrette rien (my girl Edith spittin fr).

. . . also pls don't dmg my supabase db. Idk how bad of an idea it is to publish the key for it but I was too lazy to keep it out of my server.js file.
